**Problem Statement:**

A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.

To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively. They have shortlisted Microsoft PowerBI and SQL as the BI tools for this project.

The goal of the capstone project is to design and implement a BI solution using PowerBI and SQL that can help the company manage and analyze their sales data effectively. 

To solve the above capstone project, the given steps can be followed:

Use the data source provided: Use the MySQL database provided as a data source.

Extract and clean the data: The next step is to extract the data from the identified sources and clean it to make it ready for analysis. This may involve tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

Load the data into a PowerBI: The cleaned data can then be loaded into a centralized database.

Design the dashboards and reports: Using PowerBI, data can be visualized in the form of interactive dashboards and reports. These dashboards and reports can be designed to provide useful insights and information to the management.

Perform advanced analytics: Using SQL, advanced analytics can be performed on the sales data to extract insights and inform decision-making. This may involve tasks such as creating pivot tables, running queries, and creating views.

Deploy the solution: The final step is to deploy the BI solution, including the dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics, to the sales team and management. The solution should be user-friendly and easy to use to ensure adoption and success.
